# RL_envs

**_Disclaimer_:** _this project is under development._

RL_envs is a storage for my reinforcement learning trials in modelling an environment.
The project is mostly done for "fun", it is not intended to be a guide but just a place to store experimentation for a bigger project.
Nevertheless, my intent is to create a flexible implementation, which can be adapted to any kind of environment, by just passing a set of data.
